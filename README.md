Hello Guys: 


After cloning the prject: 

Go to the server Folder: 

    1.npm install  (in odrer to install necessary packages)
    2.nodemon server.js (works by me, npm start does not work) npm start (It should run on Port 5000. Look at your teminal you should see Server is runnig on this 5000)


Go to the client Folder 

    1.npm install 
    2.npm start( you have to see Hello World on the PORT 3000 || your free port at that time)
