Hello Guys:

After cloning the project:

Go to the server Folder:

    1.npm install  (in odrer to install necessary packages)
    2.nodemon server.js (works by me, npm start does not work). It should run on url localhost:5000/ping

Go to the client Folder

    1.npm install
    2.npm start( you have to see Hello World on the PORT 3000 || your free port at that time)
